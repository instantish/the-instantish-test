# The Instantish Test
_A quick test for a healthy issue tracking process._

## Why the Instantish test?

Instantish is a startup. Our most valuable resource is time. And our goal is to save other startups time, by letting them spend _less_ time thinking about their issue tracking process.

We're still defining what an ideal process looks like. We _do_ know it depends a lot on your company's stage. Before we define the _perfect_ process, we wanted to define a _good_ process.

## How it works

How do you know your team has a good issue tracking process?

Here we propose an 5-step test, inspired by the [12-step Joel Test to Better Code](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/). Like the Joel Test, each question can be answered with a yes or no, and the whole test should take less than 2 minutes.

Give yourself 1 point for each yes. Scored out of 5!

## The questions

1. Can non-engineers create an issue without asking an engineer?
2. Do engineers have to talk to the person who created the issue before starting work on it?
3. Can PRs be traced back to issues?
4. Can issues be traced back to the initial conversation?
5. Do you review your issue tracking process at least once a month?
